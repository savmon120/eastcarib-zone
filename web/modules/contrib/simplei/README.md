# Simple Environment Indicator

Environment indicator module with a minimal approach. Works with Drupal core's Toolbar and the Gin admin theme.

- Adds colored environment indicator in the Toolbar.
- As of version 2.x, it supports Gin admin theme.


## Configuration

1. Enable the module like any other. The module works with Drupal Toolbar and
   Gin admin theme.

2. Enter a line like the examples in your `settings.local.php` file.

   The web color name(s) or hex value(s) is followed by environment name.
   You can specify background color only (foreground is white) or
   foreground/background colors.

   - Web color names.
     ```
     $settings['simple_environment_indicator'] = 'DodgerBlue Local';
     $settings['simple_environment_indicator'] = 'Black/Cyan Local';
     ```

   - Hex value colors.
     ```
     $settings['simple_environment_indicator'] = '#1E90FF DEV';
     $settings['simple_environment_indicator'] = '#333333/#DDBB00 DEV';
     ```

   - Predefined color for known environment names.
     ```
     $settings['simple_environment_indicator'] = '@production';
     ```

   - Use more accessible colors with `#access`.
     ```
     $settings['simple_environment_indicator'] = '@prod#access';
     ```

   Environment name following `@` sign will have predetermined background color.
   Recognized environment names are:
   - production, prod, prd, live (matches first two chars, pr & li)
   - staging, stage, stg, test (matches first two chars, st & te)
   - development, dev (matches first two chars, de)
   - others (local, lando, ddev, etc)

3. The indicator for logged in users appears only when Toolbar is enabled.

4. To support anonymous users, add another line in `settings.local.php`,
   ```
   $settings['simple_environment_anonymous'] = TRUE;
   ```

   If you do not like default rendering of the environment indicator, you can
   set to string instead of boolean value, such as,

   ```
   $settings['simple_environment_anonymous'] = "body:after {
   content: \"STAGE\";
   position: fixed;
   top: 0;
   left: 0;
   padding: 0.1em 0.5em;
   font-family: monospace;
   font-weight: bold;
   color: #ffffff;
   background: #8b0000;
   border: 1px solid #fff;
   z-index: 1001; }";
   ```

   You would not want to display indicator for anonymous users in production
   environment, but nothing will stop you if you have a reason to do so.
